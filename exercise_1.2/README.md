Chosen structure:
For individual recipes - dictionary is the more appropritate structure  as it provides key-value which is associated with atrtributes of a recipe.
It provides easy access to information by using keys. 
Dictionaries are a better option, as they are able to support diggerent data types, such as string, integer, and a list.

After all the recipies were put in dictionaries, the dictionaries were added to the list with all recipes. All the items in the list are stored in the a single variable, they are indexed, which makes it easy to access individual recipe or the entire collection. Which is useful for accessing, modifying and managing individual or multiple items.
